# CAPSTONE PROJECT - WORDPRESS SITE ON AWS

## VPC Architecture

Here, I created a VPC with 1 public subnet in us-east-1a and 1 public subnet in us-east-1b, making it two availability zones.

I also created two private subnets in us-east-1a and two private subnets in us-east-1b. For a total of six subnets (1 public subnet and 2 private subnets in us-east-1a, and 1 public subnet and 2 private subnets in us-east-1b)
